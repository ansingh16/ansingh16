# Astrophysicist| Quantitative Analysis & Data Science Enthusiast

---

ðŸ”­I currently work on unravelling the physical processes shaping galaxies using large-scale cosmological simulations and multi-wavelength observational data.

ðŸŒ± My passion is to use advanced data science techniques and machine learning applications to enhance my research and explore new interdisciplinary opportunities.

ðŸ¤” I am interested in transitioning into data science or other data-driven fields where my analytical and computational skills can be applied and looking to actively collaborate with like-minded experts. 

ðŸ’¬ My Expertise:
  - Astrophysics: Deep understanding of galaxy formation, evolution, and cosmology.
  - Data Science: Skilled in analyzing and interpreting large datasets using advanced statistical methods.
  - Modeling: Proficient in analysing and developing sophisticated analytical models to study complex phenomena.
  - Programming: Expertise in Python, SQL, C, Fortran and high-performance computation for scientific computing and data manipulation.
  - Machine Learning: Applying machine learning techniques to enhance data analysis and uncover patterns in data.

âš¡ **Fun fact:** When I'm not exploring galaxies, I love cycling through nature, playing the guitar, and trekking in the mountains!
